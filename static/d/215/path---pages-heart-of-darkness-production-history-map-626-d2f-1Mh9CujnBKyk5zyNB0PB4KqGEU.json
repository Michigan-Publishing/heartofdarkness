We compiled and analyzed a plethora of information on all of the actors and crew on the film—LA address, birth/death, parents' names, and occupations—to help develop a complete understanding of the types of people involved. We took interest in the division of labor in an Orson Welles production which proved to be progressive in terms of broadening the roles of all of his employees. We also included shooting locations, theaters, and significant locations in Los Angeles. The visualization of Los Angeles and how the location supplemented the film gives us a better vision of what the studio system was like in 1939. The goal of this team's study was to create an interactive map that includes the residences of the cast and crew and pertinent locations in order to better understand what life was like in Los Angeles regarding segregation, politics, and roles of people involved in the studio system.\n\nFindings\n\nJack Carter was an actor who lived in New York before traveling to Los Angeles intending to play the role of “steersman” in Welles’s unrealized film “The Heart of Darkness” (“Jack Carter (Actor)”). One of our most significant findings was that Jack Carter, the only African American actor working on the film, was living at the Dunbar Hotel far away from the rest of the cast and crew (Richard Wilson - Orson Welles Papers).This shows that the Hollywood studio system reflected the extent that Los Angeles was segregated during this time period. Although Welles was a known proponent of African American equality, Welles did not attempt to integrate Carter into the white milieu of Hollywood. However, by housing Carter in the Dunbar Hotel, Welles supplied him access to this important center for African American social, cultural, and political life.\n\nThe Dunbar Hotel\n\nThe Dunbar Hotel was an important location for the social, cultural, and political life of African American people in Los Angeles in the 1930s and 1940s (Christensen). In the 1920s, African American people faced a lack of decent hotel options and experienced discrimination through being denied access to white-owned hotels (Christensen). The Hotel Somerville, built in 1928 and later renamed the Dunbar Hotel, was the first hotel with satisfactory accomodations built for the African American community in Los Angeles (Christensen).\n\nSocial Life\n\nThe Dunbar Hotel was a popular place for African American stars to stay while in Los Angeles (Christensen). The Dunbar Hotel was located on South Central Avenue, which was famous for its nightlife consisting of nightclubs and restaurants (Meares). Some of the influential figures from the stage and screen who stayed at the Dunbar Hotel include Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Lincoln Perry, Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, Eddie Anderson, Ivie Anderson, Billie Holiday, and Duke Ellington (Sweeting). The Dunbar Hotel was also a spot for people who were seeking fame. One scholar states “the sidewalk in front of the hotel was also a place where hopeful actors lined up to vie for jobs as black extras when Hollywood casting calls came out” (Kendrick, p. 303). Additionally, the Los Angeles Sentinel describes the Dunbar Hotel as “Dunbar… place of the stage, screen, theater… stomping ground of who’s who” (McGee, p. 5). The Dunbar Hotel was also important for the Los Angeles jazz scene. Some of the most famous names of the jazz world stayed at the Dunbar Hotel, including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Billie Holiday (Meares).\n\nJack Carter Arrives at the Dunbar\n\nUpon arriving in Hollywood in October 1939, Carter was mentioned several times in the Los Angeles newspaper The California Eagle (“California Eagle : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming”). In the October 26th 1939 issue, there was an article titled “Jack Carter Here for RKO Role.” The article stated:\n\n“Jack Carter, excellent sepia \\[a term used for African American in 1930s-1940s] stage and screen actor, arrived here Monday on the Santa Fe chief limited train (“THE SUPER CHIEF – ‘THE TRAIN OF THE STARS.’”) from New York. He is slated to begin production on a RKO studio production starring Orson Welles, noted New York and London stage actor. The New York actor, making his first appearance on the coast, was quartered at the Dunbar hotel. “Heart of Darkness,” title of the film production will have Welles, “Man From Mars” ether dramatization several months ago had the entire nation jittery, as director as well as star. Carter has been a stage success in New York for years. He has also appeared in several all-sepia cast film and stage productions. Recently, he has starred in the Federal Theater Projects play “Macbeth.” His excellent portrayal of the labor boss in the labor play, “Stevedore,” brought him nationwide prominence. The sepia actor will be the only actor of his racial group in the current RKO studio production” (“California Eagle : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming”).\n\nWith an intended salary of \\$200 a week (Richard Wilson - Orson Welles Papers), Jack Carter was the lowest paid actor of the cast. The Dunbar Hotel was also far away from many of the other actors who were living near Beverly Hills (Richard Wilson - Orson Welles Papers). However, the history of the Dunbar Hotel suggests that Carter may have found a sense of community while living in Los Angeles and was certainly warmly welcomed there. At least inadvertently, Welles’s casting choice integrated Carter into a rich cultural center for African Americans during the time period.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nBarr Manuscript: “‘You Have to Hock Your House’ The Story of a Producer” by Richard Barr, University of Michigan Library (Special Collections Research Center)\n\nBrownell, Kathryn Cramer.
