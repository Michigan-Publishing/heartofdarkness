In an attempt to help RKO department heads estimate the cost of the production, Welles drew sequences from almost every portion of the film, from the proposed, non-diegetic introduction intended to explain the first-person camera technique to Kurtz’s speech presented in the visual and aural style of the Nazi Nuremberg rallies. In a sense, Welles’s drawings are the best visual approximation of what the film and Welles’s first first-person singular approach might have looked like. \n\n(The digital edition of the forthcoming book, “The Heart of Darkness”: A Critical Introduction will  make this script version and all of its  drawings available)\n\nThe detail, completeness, and insinuation of movement and editing in Welles’s storyboards gave our team the idea and the means to adapt these drawings into fully-realized animations. Our student team of animators, voice-actors, sound designers, and composers reimagined six of the most complete sequences from Welles’s Heart of Darkness, based as completely on archival evidence as possible.\n\n \n\n![](/assets/sketch3.png)\n\nCreating these Animations from Archival Sources\n\nDespite tireless research efforts, it is important to note from the onset that we purposely call these animations “reimaginings” rather than “reconstructions. Part of the reason for this differentiation is our acknowledgement of the uncertainty—and impossibility— that these images can represent what the final collaboration that Welles, his team, and RKO would have produced.  The drawings themselves come from the first of at least six versions of the script, meaning they represent Welles’s earliest conception of blocking, composition, and set design which might have radically changed before production began In order to mitigate some of this uncertainty, our team only animated sequences which maintained overwhelming continuity from the first to the last surviving screenplay draft.\n\nDespite originating on the first draft, the visual and aural style, editing, and content of these reimaginings rely most heavily on the final script version (dated December 20, 1939)--which itself represents only a contingent plan for the hypothetical final film. The actors performed the dialogue as written and in the manner occasionally instructed in this version of the script. Additionally, the scene and action descriptions motivated the order in which we inserted drawings, edited between them, and inserted transitions. The descriptions in this script also motivated the occasional instance in which the animation team had to draw a new element into one of Welles’s existing frames which did not appear in any of the drawings (such as lights illuminating  New York at the beginning of the script) or the even rarer instance when the team had to draw a complete frame from scratch in order for the action of the scene to continue without visual interruption or to maintain a crucial for the thematic message of the film. In turn, it is most accurate to specifically describe the animations as reimaginings of this December 20th version of “The Heart of Darkness” and not the script draft from which we pulled the drawings. \n\nAt times, achieving accurate visual detail in the animations is simply impossible because of the intentional ways Welles drew the images. One example of this is the scene in which an overhanging tree branch containing a large snake scrapes across the bough of the boat and attacks Melchers, one of German crewman. Both of the script versions note that Welles and his team intended to shoot this scene from Marlowe’s direct point-of-view, with the camera changing only as Marlowe moves around the bough of the boat trying to mitigate the situation, ending on a close-up of Melcher’s dead face as Marlowe tries to determine if he is alive. Instead of depicting this first-person singular approach as such, Welles drew this scene from various schematic perspectives, communicating what the scene looked like at the “boat center \\[when viewed] from \\[the] platform of pilot house,” when positioned from the “center of the boat,” as well as from the reverse angle showing the back of the boat with the action of the scene progressing incrementally between each drawing. Only the very last shot, a close-up of Melcher’s deceased face, is depicted in drawing similarly to how Welles intended it to be shot.  While hardly any of the drawings for this scene resemble the intended visual style, they were likely key pieces of information relaying the intended design of the boat, and if the scene could be shot on a sound-studio or on-location, and what, if any, expensive special effects, props, animals, and stuntmen would be needed for the extravagant scene.\n\nThe primary reason these animations are reimaginings rather than a reconstruction are the massive amounts of creative liberties that must be taken when transforming static, silent images into animated representations. The performance (both in terms of the voice and the animated movement of the characters), pacing of the editing, order of the images, camera work (e.g. our animated pans, tilts, and camera dollies), and so many other elements can hardly be approximated even with repeated readings of the script and religious viewings of Welles’s other films. Our decisions, especially those around vocal performance, only emulate the performances in Welles’s two radio versions of Heart of Darkness (1938 and 1945) in terms of their somber tone and vocal pacing, rather than resorting to mimicry of the voice of Welles and his ensemble group of actors. In turn, these animations are the dialectal result of Welles’s drawings interpreted by our necessarily imperfect historical approximation, both of which are subjected to our personal taste and modern sensibilities. For full transparency, all intentional and/or necessary differences and conflicts between script versions and the drawings, as well as any creative liberties taken for each individual animation, are documented and historically or logistically justified in the notes at the bottom of this page. \n\nMore generally, we have not tried to hide the imperfections of the animations stemming from Welles’s initial drawings. Viewers will notice that we include the frame lines of each drawing in our animations. This is intended as a constant visual reminder of the drawings’ static material existence on the page of Welles’s script. They will also notice the many explicit transitions we use, including the notable use of an animation that looks like a pen scribbling over the images. These are intended to remind viewers of Welles’s own rushed process (in which he actually scribbled over and redrew many images). They are also  indications of our own uncertainty about how portions of the animated scenes ultimately would have connected. \n\nWe celebrate these animations as reimaginings rather than reconstructions most strongly because the purposes of their creation was about engagement rather than accuracy. In a general sense, we intend for the animations to encourage viewers to consider Welles’s “ The Heart of Darkness” as not just a flurry of words spread across several production documents, but as a collection of audiovisual remnants and clues which can be juxtaposed together to create meaning. On separate pages, this information is impossible to experience and synthesize simultaneously, and readers might not have the time or the historical knowledge to conduct their own mental or digital reimagining. The animations—and moving-image media in general— in contrast excite almost all of the senses simultaneously with various types of information. \n\nThus we hope that they will engage potential viewers and readers by compiling and synthesizing the data audio visually, reaching new audiences who might be more accustomed to watching short videos than reading scripts and other historical documents. The intention is that users who read or watch our work—especially the animations— might want to search the archive themselves, and use it for whatever purposes they desire, especially with hopes to create new knowledge.\n","code":{"body":"function _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\nreturn ((_ref) => {\n  let {\n    components\n  } = _ref,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, [\"components\"]);\n\n  return React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"wrapper\",\n    components: components\n  }, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"h1\",\n    components: components\n  }, `Animations`), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `By far the most visually striking—and likely the most physically demanding and time-consuming—of his pre production work are the drawings he adorned onto his copy of the first partially completed script.
