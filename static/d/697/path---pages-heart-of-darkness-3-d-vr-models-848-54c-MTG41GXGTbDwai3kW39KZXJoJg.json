Both miniatures—which survive only from behind-the-scenes photographs— were important for the visual design of the film, which Welles and his collaborators planned to depict through use of the most up-to-date special effects. Using  3D modeling software, we have constructed three-dimensional models of these two spaces that will be visible on computer monitors, with virtual reality (VR) headsets, or in 3D caves. Our presentation of this material here was only made possible because of the expertise of Dr. Theodore Hall and Stephanie O’Malley at the University of Michigan’s Duderstadt Center.\t\n\nWelles and his team’s initial need for the miniatures stemmed from the necessity to cut down the production’s inflated budget. It was cheaper to build a miniature boat and temple than to create lifesize sets and film on location or in a studio. [Special effect cinematography would then make the miniatures appear life-size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IXHALCKz-g). Their plan also involved screen processes, which combines foreground action with pre-filmed backgrounds in order for the footage to appear as if it had been filmed on location, instead of with a miniature in studio. For example, on the riverboat, pre-filmed backgrounds of riverbanks would be used during filming to create the appearance of the shoreline rushing past the windows of the boat.\n\nBy recreating these miniatures in 3D model form, we are able to explore the sets that Welles wished to create and speculate how they may have been integrated in the film as special effects. The VR simulation also replicates the subjective experience that Welles wanted to create in the film, allowing audience members to literally adopt Marlow’s point of view and become active participants who can move through the digital space as the camera and characters would have. \n\nThe steamboat’s narrative and visual importance lies in the fact that it was the location at the center of most of the journey along the unnamed river , where Marlowe learns most of what we know of Kurtz and his demagogic significance to the German crew. The VR experiences immediately makes evident how small and claustrophobic the boat was supposed to be, which suggests the boat might have worked as a metaphor for socio-political restrictiveness of the nazi and fascist ideologies embodied and practiced by most of the members onboard.   \n\nThe temple, however, was more explicitly tied into the main political message of the film. Of the film’s final scene, Welles insisted, “more than any other \\[scene] in the movie, \\[this] requires a tremendous amount of space, the biggest set possible.” Welles wanted to create a large sense of space, the largest imaginable, in order to mirror the way that fascist parades and gatherings relied on visual grandiosity as signs of power and national unity.  While the sense of space within the VR model is most likely larger than Welles could have created,  it allows viewers to approximate Welles’s visual plan for the scene and its connection to the film’s anti-fascist agenda.\n","code":{"body":"function _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\nreturn ((_ref) => {\n  let {\n    components\n  } = _ref,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, [\"components\"]);\n\n  return React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"wrapper\",\n    components: components\n  }, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"img\",\n    components: components,\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    props: {\n      \"src\": \"/assets/boat-for-landing-page.png\",\n      \"alt\": null,\n      \"title\": \"3D Model of the boat that carries Marlow down the river.\"\n    }\n  })), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `Early in the pre-production process, Welles commissioned two set models, one of the boat that carries Marlow and the largely German crew down the river, and the other of Kurtz’s temple in the jungle.
