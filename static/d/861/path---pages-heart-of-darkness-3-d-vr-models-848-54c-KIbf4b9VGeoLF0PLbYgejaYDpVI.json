Specifically, he wanted to build the steamboat that a majority of the film centers around, and the temple in which Kurtz held his throne in the Congo. The initial need for the miniatures stemmed from the necessity to cut budgetary costs. It would be cheaper to build a miniature boat and temple than to create lifesize sets and film on location or in a studio. This then led to the use of miniatures as special effects. Welles was also going to uses screen processes in order to create the appearance of the river banks rushing past the windows of the boat, so that to the audience it would seem as if it had been filmed on location, instead of with a miniature. \n\nBy recreating these miniatures in 3D model form, it makes it possible to show how miniatures are used in films with regards to special effects. The VR experience also replicates the subjective experience that Welles wanted to create in the film. It will also allow audience members and participants to visualize the scene and move through the space as the camera and characters would have. \n\nThe steamboat’s importance lies in the fact was the center of most of the journey along the Congo and is the vessel for Marlow’s travel as well as his growing knowledge of Kurtz and his significance. The temple, however, was tied into the main political message of the film. Welles wanted to create a large sense of space, the largest imaginable, in order to mirror the way that fascist themes were presented. In fact, the sense of space within the VR model is most likely larger than Welles could have created because it allows one to place themselves within the actual space. \n\nAs Welles “Heart of Darkness” was never fully realized, and reconstructions are always subjective, these models will allow people to reshoot the scenes themselves, thus putting the reimagining powers in the hands of others and recentering the idea that reconstructions are even possible.\n","code":{"body":"function _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\nreturn ((_ref) => {\n  let {\n    components\n  } = _ref,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, [\"components\"]);\n\n  return React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"wrapper\",\n    components: components\n  }, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `When Orson Welles was in the pre-production stages of “Heart of Darkness,” he planned on creating two miniature models of significant set pieces.
