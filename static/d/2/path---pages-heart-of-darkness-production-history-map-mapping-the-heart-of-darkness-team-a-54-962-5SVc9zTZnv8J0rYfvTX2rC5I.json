At this point, I designed and led the “Interactive Production History Map,” which studied the labor force used during the film’s pre-production and where they lived in Los Angeles in 1939-1940. My interest in sociology led me to the project, specifically my interest in historical social inequalities. I met on a weekly basis with two other undergraduate students, Alexandra Niforos and Danielle Williams, to complete short-term tasks such as finding voting records and parent occupations of cast and crew members. At weekly meetings, we discussed and analyzed our findings from the past week, determined what research methods were successful, and decided what methods we no longer planned to use.\n\nAdditionally, the undergraduate research team leaders, including myself, Jordan, Sydney, and Elijah, continued weekly meetings with Vincent to define larger research goals. After these meetings, I broke down the larger goals for my project into smaller tasks and relayed them to the team of undergraduates working on the map project. For example, one larger task that was discussed at a group meeting with Vincent was finding the socioeconomic backgrounds of the cast and crew members of “The Heart of Darkness.” I then assigned each member of my research team specific people to research. Each member of the smaller team would then share their findings with the group periodically. I also spent time in the meetings going over various genealogical research methods such as websites and effective research methods.\n\nThis combination of meeting styles helped me learn as a researcher while also completing my project goals. This was not only because I had a mentor that constantly kept the research on track, but also because I was able to develop as an independent researcher. Additionally, the technical aspect of this project would not have been possible without the help of ArcGIS consultants at the University of Michigan, especially Peter Knoop and Abbey Roelofs, who showed the research team how to create and customize the map. Overall, \"Interactive Production History Map\" was a team effort and a unique learning experience for everyone involved.\n\nErin Ringel, 2020\n","code":{"body":"function _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\nreturn ((_ref) => {\n  let {\n    components\n  } = _ref,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, [\"components\"]);\n\n  return React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"wrapper\",\n    components: components\n  }, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `While all the research assistants worked together to discover the reasons why the film was never made during the first year of “The Heart of Darkness” project, the project began to branch off in different directions during the second year.
