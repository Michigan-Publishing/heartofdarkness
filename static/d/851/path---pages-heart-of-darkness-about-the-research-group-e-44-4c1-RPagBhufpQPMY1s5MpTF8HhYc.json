He was a member of the audiovisual and animation research teams. After graduation, he will continue pursuing his passion for video production as an assistant video editor at Spacestation, a digital production company in Brooklyn, NY. \n\nInterview with team leader Jordan Stanton\n\nHow did it help and/or better your college career?\n\n  When I entered the University of Michigan’s Film, Television, and Media major as a freshman, I was not sure where my education would take me. My initial involvement with this project was my first taste of what a media studies and humanities education stood to offer. During my first year with the project, I spent hours at the University of Michigan Special Collections Research Center reading archival transcripts and interviews with Orson Welles, slowly discovering cinematic concepts that had never crossed my mind. As a sophomore, I led a team of researchers, assigning weekly tasks, providing constructive feedback, and ultimately presenting the team’s work to a crowd of University employees and scholars. As a junior, I played the role of producer, casting voice actors, working with composers, and collaborating with a fellow researcher on five different animations. As a senior, I will have the privilege of travelling with the whole team to present our findings during a panel at the annual SCMS film conference in Denver. In retrospect, this project offered me a degree of flexibility, variety, and responsibility that my classes and even summer internships never could. I have no doubt that these leadership experiences will prove invaluable as I transition from my undergraduate career to professional work in the entertainment industry. \n\nWhat about the digital construction of this project do you believe will/can benefit other publications?\n\n\tThe digital construction of this project effectively democratizes the data and research we spent the past four years collecting. It provides readers with the opportunity to circumvent the complex and often daunting process of archival research. Those interested in learning more about Orson Welles’s early career, his influences, and  “The Heart of Darkness” project need not engage in costly document requests, out of state travel, or long searches through special collections archives. Instead, they can engage with the source material - scripts, notes, influential films, extensive pre production materials, and even a handful of audiovisual renderings of Welles’s sketches - using an organized and accessible digital archive.\n\nMore specifically, aspects of this project such as the animated reimaginings of Welles’s scene sketches go a long way to help . Furthermore, in their function as engaging, audiovisual pieces, they push the envelope of archival research materials in the broadness and accessibility of their appeal. In other words, the animations make it possible for interested in engaging with Welles’s work to do so through a medium that is atypical and fun, rather than dense. By utilizing novel approaches in the digital construction of our project, our team will hopefully inspire creative presentation solutions for archival film studies of the future. \n\nWhy should other faculty/digital projects collaborate with undergraduates?\n\nIn my experience, this project’s style of intergenerational collaboration fostered a tradition of teaching and learning that was instrumental in the project’s longevity and continuity. For reference, as of Winter 2020, I am in my 4th year with this project. Almost every week over the course of those four years, our team met in person for an hour. We shared updates on our respective projects, provided constructive feedback to our peers, and laid out a roadmap of our goals for the coming weeks. This casual and consistent meeting style instilled a sense of accountability among our group members and, most importantly, opened the floor to a multitude of perspectives. More specifically, this breadth of perspective was integral in considering the ways that aspects of the project’s audiovisual content could be constructed and presented to appeal to a broader spectrum of viewers.\n","code":{"body":"function _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\nreturn ((_ref) => {\n  let {\n    components\n  } = _ref,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, [\"components\"]);\n\n  return React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"wrapper\",\n    components: components\n  }, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `About the research group`), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `Jordan Stanton is a senior pursuing a dual degree in Film, TV, and Media and Business Administration at the University of Michigan.
