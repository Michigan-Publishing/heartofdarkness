Though our research did not confirm that he  screened Stagecoach an exorbitant number of times, we do know that he watched it along with 68 other films leading up to and during the pre-production of Heart of Darkness (HOD). Welles’s assistants compiled the names of these films in a series of documents on Welles’s behalf. \n\nMany of the films functioned as a crash course of sorts for Welles, a novice filmmaker new to the rigors and technical considerations of Hollywood film production. Our research reveals that Welles intended another bulk of the films to have a more direct and meaningful impact on the production of HOD. In fact, many of the films are the only surviving evidence of how HOD would have looked and sounded. Welles intended to insert sections from the films directly into HOD to decrease production costs, and used the films to influence the ways he would portray and subvert fascist ideology in HOD.\n\n**Visual and Thematic Implications**\n\nDuring a production budget meeting on December 14th, 1939, RKO’s production team proposed that searching for and purchasing “stock shots” would be a viable means to “save cost of expensive mats in scenes from boat in which we see the coast of the dark country.” Purchasing and utilizing footage from other films was a fairly common practice at the time, as traveling across the world to capture authentic footage in exotic settings was incredibly expensive (Behlmer, p.128). One document titled “Movie Notes” not only takes note of the price per foot of film he planned to pay for the footage but, in some cases, directly specifies the scenes that Welles intended on cutting into HOD. In a sense, therefore, the clips that Welles and his assistants referenced in these documents give us the clearest indication of what Heart of Darkness, perhaps the most famous unmade film of all time, would have actually looked like. \n\n**Full directory of clips we have digitized that Orson Welles and his team directly referenced in their notes or considered purchasing**\n\n**Referenced Clips Master List (LINK/VIDEO PLAYER)**\n\n**Full directory of films that Orson Welles during the production of HOD:**\n\n**Master List of All Films Watched (LINK TO LANDING PAGE)**\n\nEthnographic films like The Four Feathers (1939), Baboona (1935), Chang (1927), and Congorilla (1932), are rife with footage of lush jungles, rushing rivers, and exotic animals. Sanders of the River is a British film based on the stories of Edgar Wallace that incorporates authentic, on-location shots of native African tribes conducting rituals and going about everyday life. For these reasons, these ethnographic and narrative films were particularly attractive to Welles as he set out to construct HOD while keeping production costs low. A majority of the clips that Welles had specified and planned on purchasing from all of these films were either shots of wildlife, landscapes, or natives. The pictures below illuminate some specific examples of clips Welles hoped to purchase and splice into HOD (Movie Notes, p.1/26 and Film Material #5, p.1). In a sense, therefore, Welles’s interest in purchasing and potentially incorporating these clips speaks to his dedication to presenting a compelling and authentic depiction of a jungle landscape in HOD while maintaining low production costs. \n\n![](/assets/baboona.png)\n\n![](/assets/congorilla.png)\n\n![](/assets/sanders-1.png)\n\n![](/assets/sanders-2.png)\n\nIn order to understand the selection and placement of these purchased film clips within HOD, we turned to the earliest draft of HOD, a document that provides insights into the thematic design of the river on which Marlow and his crew travelled. In the draft, which resembles a detailed outline, Welles claims that the river was “the single most important aspect of the story” (Film Summary Undated, p.15). It is important to note that, unlike the other script drafts, this outline includes no references to Nazism and fascism. Thus, Welles paid an incredible amount of attention to the river as a structural storytelling device. \n\nWelles describes the river in six sections, each of which helps tell a story of decay and descent into thematic darkness. In the earliest sections, the river is “broad” and the surrounding jungle is “biggest and healthiest” (Film Summary Undated, p.16). However, as Marlow proceeds down the river toward later sections, the river becomes narrower, the animal life grows more menacing, and the crew is met with a “terrible white fog” (Film Summary Undated, p.19). These distinctions between the sections of the river are pertinent to understanding how Welles might have utilized the clips from the above films to actualize the story of decay he so meticulously described in this early script outline. In essence, as the film’s themes grew more ominous and bleak during Marlow’s convergence on Kurtz, so too would the film’s actual setting. \n\n![](/assets/six-sections.png)\n\nFor example, we can reasonably assume that shots of baboons, giraffes, elephants, and wildebeests from Congorilla and Baboona would fit into section 1 of the river, a point in which the river is teeming with life. On page 56 of the final script, Welles calls for a visual of the jungle and river ahead, a relatively open annotation. Since this portion of the script is only a few pages after the start of the voyage downriver, it is conceivable that this portion would fall within section 1 of the river and that the shots would have been integrated near page 56 (Final Script, p.56). \n\n![](/assets/river-and-baboons.png)\n\nNext, looking at the above shots of crocodiles, we know that they would fit into the second section in which vegetation recedes and animal life becomes reptilian and menacing. In this light, the film summary document makes it clear that the films watched by Welles during the production of HOD played more than just a role in budget cutting - they would function as visual aids in depicting Marlow and his crew’s descent into the heart of darkness. \n\n**Political and Ideological Implications**\n\nAs Welles prepared Heart of Darkness in September 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Antifascism was not just another political conflict for Welles, it was the movement that grasped Welles’ imagination and work like no other. At this time, Hollywood had only produced one explicitly anti-fascist film and was not keen on producing any other war-related films out of fear of government censorship and sparking controversy in European markets. \n\nDespite the potential controversy,  Welles pitched the idea of Heart of Darkness to RKO as an explicitly antifascist film. Welles not only hoped to draw a direct comparison between Hitler and Kurtz, but also between the Nazis and Kurtz’s native followers. In the Heart of Darkness research bible, Welles’s assistants explicitly state Welles’s intentions to imagine Kurtz and his crew as Nazis (Research Bible). \n\n![](/assets/nazi-1.png)\n\nResearch Bible Page 3\n\n![](/assets/nazi-2.png)\n\nResearch Bible Page 4\n\nWelles’s attack on the Nazi system problematically relied on maintaining stereotypes of native tribes as primitive, cult-like and violent people and making direct comparisons between their actions and beliefs to that of their Nazi counterparts. This comparison is most notable when Marlow’s crew first witnesses Kurtz as he delivers a speech to praying natives. Kurtz greets the natives and they respond with a “low harmonized wail” and rise to their knees (Final Script, p. 135). As they return back to their original praying position, “the company men clumsily follow the natives’ action” (Final Script, p. 135). In this instance, Welles aligns the German crew and the praying natives, establishing their common venerance of an idolized supreme leader. The Nazis believed that they were a primitive ideal - that through their different heritages, they returned to an idealized race. However, through his engagement with fascism in this scene and throughout the script, Welles asserts that Nazis are effectively the most primitive - the epitome of a reductive, violent, and anti-modern group with behavior and thought analogous that that of stone age people. \n\nWelles’s engagement with fascism in the film did not end there. Instead, with the help of the aforementioned films, Welles had hoped to make a more substantive statement about the global scope of facism and its threats. The films that Welles demonstrated an interest in acquiring and incorporating Heart of Darkness were set in locations all over the world, not just in Africa. For example, Chang (1927) and The Lost Patrol (1934) were set in Thailand and Mesopotamia, respectively. \n\n![](/assets/world.png)\n\nWelles’s interest in acquiring these films suggests that he was less interested in creating an accurate replica of the African jungle than he was in creating a homogenous jungle atmosphere that drew on aspects of different cultures. The hybrid-jungle atmosphere he intended to portray in HOD was interestingly dubbed “mysterious land #4” in the research bible (I am assuming a citation already exists). Though the collective mise en scène of the film connects to the jungle, it is not representative of a particular place. Therefore, in drawing on ethnographic films set in different locations to create the mysterious land in HOD, Welles asserts that fascism is capable of extending its reach beyond Europe and especially beyond Conrad’s African Congo. \n\n\n\n**Citations**\n\nBehlmer, Rudy. “Deja View.” American Cinematographer, vol. 80, no. 6, June 1999, p. 128.\n\n“Movie Notes.” Manuscripts Department, Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana.\n\nWelles, Orson. “Film Summary Undated.” UCLA Special Collections Library, Los Angeles, CA.\n\nFinal Script\n\nResearch Bible\n","code":{"body":"function _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\nreturn ((_ref) => {\n  let {\n    components\n  } = _ref,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, [\"components\"]);\n\n  return React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"wrapper\",\n    components: components\n  }, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `When discussing Orson Welles’s  artistic influences, many scholars and biographers are quick to bring up his affinity for John Ford’s 1939 western, Stagecoach, a film he supposedly watched 40 times in his early career.
