Database of Films Welles Watched



When it comes to Orson Welles and his artistic influences, many scholars and biographers are quick to bring up his affinity for John Ford’s 1939 western, Stagecoach, a film he supposedly watched 40 times in his early career. Though our research hasn’t confirmed that he has in fact watched Stagecoach 40 times, we do know that he watched it along with 66 other films leading up to and during the production of Heart of Darkness (HOD). Welles’s assistants compiled the names of these films in a series of documents on Welles’s behalf for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the films functioned as a crash course of sorts for Welles, a novice filmmaker new to the rigors and technical considerations of Hollywood film production. However, upon closer inspection of these documents, it became clear that films were intended to have a more direct and meaningful impact on the production of HOD. More specifically, Welles intended to use the films to directly cut clips of jungles, rivers, and wild animals into HOD and to influence how he would portray natives and fascists in the film. 

Of the films on the list, OW placed a greater focus on safari and jungle oriented ethnographic and narrative films. Congorilla, Sanders of the River, and Baboona are examples of such films. One document titled “budget cutting 04” illuminates the reason why Welles took a heightened interest in these types of films. During a budget meeting on December 14th, 1939, it was proposed that searching for and purchasing “stock shots” would be a viable means to “save cost of expensive mats in scenes from boat in which we see the coast of the dark country.” This snippet seems to suggest that the films and clips listed above served a greater purpose than simple stylistic influence for Welles during his early career. Another document titled “Movie Notes” not only details some of the films that Welles watched, but also takes note of the films that he intended on purchasing and, in some cases, the price per foot of film he planned to pay for the footage.
