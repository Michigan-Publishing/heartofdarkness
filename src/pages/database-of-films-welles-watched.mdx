**Database of Films Welles Watched**

When it comes to Orson Welles and his artistic influences, many scholars and biographers are quick to bring up his affinity for John Ford’s 1939 western, Stagecoach, a film he supposedly watched 40 times in his early career. Though our research hasn’t confirmed that he has in fact watched Stagecoach 40 times, we do know that he watched it along with 66 other films leading up to and during the production of Heart of Darkness (HOD). Welles’s assistants compiled the names of these films in a series of documents on Welles’s behalf for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the films functioned as a crash course of sorts for Welles, a novice filmmaker new to the rigors and technical considerations of Hollywood film production. However, upon closer inspection of these documents, it becomes clear that the films were intended to have a more direct and meaningful impact on the production of HOD. More specifically, Welles intended to insert sections from the films directly into HOD to decrease production costs, and used the films to influence the ways he would portray fascism in HOD.

**Visual and Thematic Implications**

During a production budget meeting on December 14th, 1939, it was proposed that searching for and purchasing “stock shots” would be a viable means to “save cost of expensive mats in scenes from boat in which we see the coast of the dark country.” Purchasing and utilizing footage from other films was a fairly common practice at the time, as traveling across the world to capture authentic footage in exotic settings was incredibly expensive. (\*\**text of history of inserting jungle footage into films) One document titled “Movie Notes” not only takes note of the price per foot of film he planned to pay for the footage but, in some cases, directly specifies the scenes that Welles intended on cutting into HOD. In a sense, therefore, the clips that Welles and his assistants referenced in these documents give us the clearest indication of what Heart of Darkness, perhaps the most famous unmade film of all time, would have actually looked like.

Ethnographic films like The Four Feathers (1939), Baboona (1935), Chang (1927), and Congorilla (1932), are rife with footage of lush jungles, rushing rivers, and exotic animals. For this reason, these ethnographic films were particularly attractive to Welles as he set out to construct HOD while keeping production costs low. The pictures below illuminate some examples of clips Welles hoped to purchase and splice into HOD.

In order to understand the selection and placement of these purchased film clips within HOD, we turned to the earliest draft of HOD, a document that provides insights into the thematic design of the river on which Marlow and his crew travelled. In the draft, Welles claims that the river was “the single most important aspect of the story” (early script). It is important to note that this script was written before the Nazis invaded Poland and aspects of Nazism and fascism manifested themselves into the script and characters like Kurtz. Because of this, Welles paid an incredible amount of attention to the river. 

Welles describes the river in six sections, each of which helps tell a story of decay and descent into darkness. In the earliest sections, the river is “broad” and the surrounding jungle is “biggest and healthiest” (early script). However, as Marlow proceeds down the river toward later sections, the river becomes narrower, the animal life grows more menacing, and the crew is met with a “terrible white fog” (early script). These distinctions between the sections of the river are pertinent to understanding how Welles might have used the clips from the above films to tell the story of HOD visually. 

For example, we can reasonably assume that shots of baboons, giraffes, elephants, and wildebeests from Congorilla and Baboona would fit into section 1 of the river, a point in which the river is teeming with life. On page 56 of the script, OW calls for a visual of the jungle and river ahead, a relatively open annotation. Since page 56 is only a few pages after the start of the voyage downriver, it is conceivable that these shots would have been integrated there. Next, looking to the above shots of crocodiles, we know that they would fit into the second section in which vegetation recedes and animal life becomes reptilian and menacing. In this light, the film summary document makes it clear that the films watched by Welles during the production of HOD played more than just a role in budget cutting - they too would be used to tell a story. 			

**Political and Ideological Implications**

As Welles prepared Heart of Darkness in September 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Antifascism was not just another political conflict for Welles, it was the movement that grasped Welles’ imagination and work like no other. At this time, Hollywood had only produced one explicitly anti-fascist film and was not keen on producing any other war-related films out of fear of government censorship and sparking controversy in European markets. 

However, when Welles pitched the idea of Heart of Darkness to RKO, he was very intentional about the way that the film would portray fascism. More specifically, Welles had hoped to draw a direct comparison between Hitler and Kurtz, and consequently, between the Nazis and Kurtz’s native followers. More specifically, Welles hoped to rely on stereotypes of primitivism, lack of civility, and childishness in his depiction of native tribes as a way to assert the foolishness of their Nazi counterparts. These ideological motives are further illuminated by Welles’s interest in using footage from Sanders of the River (1935). Sanders of the River was a British film based on the stories of Edgar Wallace. Bosambo (played by Paul Robeson) is an ally of Sanders, a white district commissioner of colonial Nigeria. When Sanders goes on leave, conflict erupts between the tribes in Nigeria and Bosambo is captured, but Sanders saves the day in the end. At first glance, it seems as if Welles was merely looking for different shots of natives that he could cut into the HOD to save budget costs.

Paul Robeson was an African-American singer, actor, and civil rights activist studying pan-African culture in London through music and language. He felt portraying the Nigerian leader Bosambo with cultural accuracy and dignity would help audiences understand and respect the roots of Black culture. Under the condition that the African characters in the film would be portrayed positively, Robeson took the role. However, upon the film’s completion, Robeson discovered that the film’s message had changed, now justifying imperialism and upholding the “White Man’s Burden”. Bosambo was not portrayed as a strong leader, but rather a servant to the courageous British white men. Robeson was furious at this portrayal, and attempted to no avail to buy back all the prints in prevention of it being shown. The film, however, ended up being the 11th most popular film at the British box office in 1935-1936. In 1938, Robeson said “It is the only film of mine that can be shown in Italy or Germany, for it shows the negro as Fascist states desire him - savage and childish”. 

Seven of the twelve clips Welles had specified and planned on purchasing from Sanders of the River were shots of natives. Given Welles’s interest in purchasing footage from Sanders of the River, his anti-fascist motives, and the suboptimal portrayal of natives in Sanders of the River, it is possible that these clips provide a unique indication as to the way that natives would have been portrayed in HOD.

Furthermore, the films that OW demonstrated interest in acquiring were set in locations all over the world, not just in Africa. For example, Chang (1927) and The Lost Patrol (1934) were set in Thailand and Mesopotamia, respectively. Welles’s interest in acquiring these films suggests that he was less interested in creating an accurate replica of the African jungle than he was in creating a homogenous jungle atmosphere that drew on aspects of different cultures. The hybrid-jungle atmosphere he intended to portray in HOD was interestingly dubbed “mysterious land #4” in the research bible. Though the collective mis en scene of the film connects to jungle, it is not representative of a particular place. Therefore, in drawing on ethnographic films set in different locations to create the mysterious land in HOD, Welles asserts that fascism is capable of extending its reach beyond Africa.
