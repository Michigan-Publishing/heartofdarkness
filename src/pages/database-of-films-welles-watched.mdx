Database of Films Welles Watched



When it comes to Orson Welles and his artistic influences, many scholars and biographers are quick to bring up his affinity for John Ford’s 1939 western, Stagecoach, a film he supposedly watched 40 times in his early career. Though our research hasn’t confirmed that he has in fact watched Stagecoach 40 times, we do know that he watched it along with 66 other films leading up to and during the production of Heart of Darkness (HOD). Welles’s assistants compiled the names of these films in a series of documents on Welles’s behalf for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the films functioned as a crash course of sorts for Welles, a novice filmmaker new to the rigors and technical considerations of Hollywood film production. However, upon closer inspection of these documents, it becomes clear that the films were intended to have a more direct and meaningful impact on the production of HOD. More specifically, Welles intended to use the films to directly cut clips of jungles, rivers, and wild animals into HOD and to influence the ways he would portray natives and fascists in the film.

Some of the films on the list are ethnographic films depicting animals, rivers, and jungles that Welles was considering directly cutting into HOD. This was a fairly common practice at the time, as traveling across the world to capture authentic footage in these settings was incredibly expensive. During a budget meeting on December 14th, 1939, it was proposed that searching for and purchasing “stock shots” would be a viable means to “save cost of expensive mats in scenes from boat in which we see the coast of the dark country.” One document titled “Movie Notes” not only takes note of the price per foot of film he planned to pay for the footage but, in some cases, directly specifies the scenes that Welles intended on cutting into HOD. In a sense, therefore, the clips that Welles and his assistants referenced in these documents give us the clearest indication of what HOD would have actually looked like.
