# Animations

Some of the most striking traces of the work Orson Welles did to prepare “The Heart of Darkness” are the numerous drawings he made in the margins and on the verso side of the pages of the first typewritten draft of the script. Welles made drawings that correspond to many parts of the planned film, from the proposed, non-diegetic introduction intended to explain the subjective camera technique to Kurtz’s speech presented in the visual and aural style of the Nuremberg Rallies. Welles’s drawings provide some of the best indications of what his first first-person singular approach to feature filmmaking might have looked like. Some also show vectors of movement that suggested we might adapt these drawings to produce fully-realized animations. Our student team of animators, voice-actors, sound designers, and composers reimagined six sequences from Welles’s “The Heart of Darkness” based on these drawings, along with other archival documents.

These animations are reimaginings, not “reconstructions” based on Welles’s working notes on blocking, composition, and set design for the live action film he wanted to make. He made the drawings on the first version of the script, although the six sets of drawings which we chose to animate correspond to scenes that are also present in later versions, including the last known surviving draft of the screenplay, dated December 20, 1939, which guided our creative decisions about the visual and aural contents of these animations and inspired the addition of a few visual elements that are not part of Welles’s original drawings. Voice actors performed the dialogue as written, and in the manner sometimes indicated, in the final version of the script, although we also took cues on tone and pacing from recordings of Welles’s two broadcast radio versions of Heart of Darkness (1938 and 1945).
