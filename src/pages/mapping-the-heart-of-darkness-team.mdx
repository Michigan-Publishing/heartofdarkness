Mapping "The Heart of Darkness" Team

**Introduction** 

The goal of this team's study was to create an interactive map of Los Angeles in 1939 in order to better understand the nuances (casting, hiring, finding locations to film, etc) that went into the pre-production stage and where everyone and everything involved in the film was located. We attempted to create a historical snapshot of the labor force employed for the unrealized film, “The Heart of Darkness.” This is a unique branch of the project because we are interested in how the residences of the cast and crew and census data from the time period illustrate the demography of Los Angeles. We compiled and analyzed a plethora of information on all of the actors and crew on the film—LA address, birth/death, parents' names, and occupations—to help develop a complete understanding of the types of people involved. We took interest in the division of labor in an Orson Welles production which proved to be progressive in terms of broadening the roles of his employees. We also included shooting locations, theaters, and significant locations in Los Angeles. The visualization of Los Angeles and how the location supplemented the film gives us a better vision of what the studio system was like in 1939.

**Segregation by Race and Socioeconomic Status**

One of our most significant findings was that Jack Carter, the only African-American actor working on the film, was living at the Dunbar Hotel far away from the rest of the cast and crew (Wilson-Welles: Richard Wilson). This shows that the Hollywood studio system reflected the extent that Los Angeles was segregated during this time period. Although Welles was pretty liberal, he was unable to have Carter live near the other actors. Welles did not attempt to integrate Carter into the white milieu of Hollywood, possibly because he was unable to. However, Welles did house carter in the Dunbar Hotel, and further research suggests that by living there, Carter had access to this important center for African-American social and political life.
