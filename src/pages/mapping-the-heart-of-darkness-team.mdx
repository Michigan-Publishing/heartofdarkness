The second year of “The Heart of Darkness” project is when the research began to branch off in different directions. The project that I worked on is titled “Interactive Production History Map,” which studies the labor force of Los Angeles in 1939-1940. My interest in sociology led me to the project because of its focus on historical social inequalities. I met on a weekly basis with a team of two other undergraduate students, Danielle Williams and Alexandra Niforos, to complete short-term tasks. We went over what our findings were from the past week, what research methods were successful, and what research methods were unsuccessful. 

Additionally, the undergraduate research team leaders continued weekly meetings with Mr. Longo to define larger research goals. After these meetings, I would break down the goals for my project into small tasks that I would relay to the team of undergraduates working on the map project. For example, one larger task that was discussed at a group meeting with Mr. Longo was finding the socioeconomic backgrounds of the cast and crew members of “The Heart of Darkness.” I would break down the members into groups and assign them to various members of the team. After a few weeks, each member of the smaller team would share their findings with the group. I would mix this meeting structure with meetings where I would show the other undergraduate students what I knew about genealogical and archival research. 

This combination of meeting styles resulted in an experience that helped us learn as researchers while also completing our research goals. The technical side of this project would not have been possible without the help of ArcGIS consultants, who showed us how to create and customize the map. Overall, "Interactive Production History Map" was a team effort and a unique learning experience for everyone involved.
