**Introduction** 

The goal of this team's study was to create an interactive map of Los Angeles in 1939 in order to better understand the nuances (casting, hiring, finding locations to film, etc) that went into the pre-production stage and where everyone and everything involved in the film was located. We attempted to create a historical snapshot of the labor force employed for the unrealized film, “The Heart of Darkness.” This is a unique branch of the project because we are interested in how the residences of the cast and crew and census data from the time period illustrate the demography of Los Angeles. We compiled and analyzed a plethora of information on all of the actors and crew on the film—LA address, birth/death, parents' names, and occupations—to help develop a complete understanding of the types of people involved. We took interest in the division of labor in an Orson Welles production which proved to be progressive in terms of broadening the roles of his employees. We also included shooting locations, theaters, and significant locations in Los Angeles. The visualization of Los Angeles and how the location supplemented the film gives us a better vision of what the studio system was like in 1939.

**Segregation by Race and Socioeconomic Status**

One of our most significant findings was that Jack Carter, the only African American actor working on the film, was living at the Dunbar Hotel far away from the rest of the cast and crew (Wilson-Welles: Richard Wilson). This shows that the Hollywood studio system reflected the extent that Los Angeles was segregated during this time period. Although Welles was pretty liberal, he was unable to have Carter live near the other actors. Welles did not attempt to integrate Carter into the white milieu of Hollywood, possibly because he was unable to. However, Welles did house carter in the Dunbar Hotel, and further research suggests that by living there, Carter had access to this important center for African American social and political life.

**The Dunbar Hotel**

_Introduction_

The Dunbar Hotel was an important location for African American people in Los Angeles in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1920s, African American people faced a lack of decent hotel options and experienced discrimination through being denied access to white-owned hotels, but Hotel Somerville (later renamed the Dunbar Hotel) changed this; it was the first hotel with satisfactory accomodations built for the African American community in Los Angeles (Christensen). Our purpose is to shed light on the importance of the hotel and illustrate its role in the social and political lives of African Americans in Los Angeles during this time period (Christensen).

_Social Life_

The Dunbar Hotel was a popular place for African American stars to stay while in Los Angeles. In numerous articles in The California Eagle under the column “Globe News and Gossip,” columnist Jay Gould described various noteworthy people who stayed at The Dunbar Hotel (Gould, 1940). Some of the influential figures from the stage and screen who stayed at the Dunbar Hotel include Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Lincoln Perry, Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, Eddie Anderson, Ivie Anderson, Billie Holiday, and Duke Ellington (Sweeting). The Dunbar Hotel was also a spot for people who were seeking fame. One scholar states “the sidewalk in front of the hotel was also a place where hopeful actors lined up to vie for jobs as black extras when Hollywood casting calls came out” (Kendrick, p. 303). The Los Angeles Sentinel describes the Dunbar Hotel as “Dunbar… place of the stage, screen, theater… stomping ground of who’s who” (McGee, p. 5). The Dunbar Hotel was also important for the Los Angeles jazz scene. Some of the most famous names of the jazz world stayed at the Dunbar Hotel, including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Billie Holiday (Meares).

**Jack Carter**

Jack Carter (1902-1967) was an African American actor who lived in New York before traveling to Los Angeles intending to play the role of “steersman” in Welles’s unrealized film “The Heart of Darkness” (“Jack Carter (Actor)”). The Dunbar Hotel was located on South Central Avenue, which was famous for its nightlife consisting of nightclubs and restaurants (Meares).  Located in “the heart of LA’s black community” (Meares), The Dunbar Hotel was a significant location for African American actors and musicians. Although Carter was situated far away from the rest of the cast and crew, he was at a center of African American culture and political life during a turning point in American history. Upon arriving in Hollywood in October 1939, Carter was mentioned several times in the Los Angeles newspaper The California Eagle, one of the oldest African-American newspapers in the United States. In the October 26th issue, there was an article titled “Jack Carter Here for RKO Role.” The article stated:

“Jack Carter, excellent sepia (term used for African American in 30s-40s) stage and screen actor, arrived here Monday on the Santa Fe chief limited (train) (“THE SUPER CHIEF – ‘THE TRAIN OF THE STARS.’”) from New York. He is slated to begin production on a RKO studio production starring Orson Welles, noted New York and London stage actor. The New York actor, making his first appearance on the coast, was quartered at the Dunbar hotel. “Heart of Darkness,” title of the film production will have Welles, “Man From Mars” either dramatization several months ago had the entire nation jittery, as director as well as star. Carter has been a stage success in New York for years. He has also appeared in several all-sepia cast film and stage productions. Recently, he has starred in the Federal Theater Projects play “Macbeth.” His excellent portrayal of the lavor boss in the labor play, “Stevedore,” brought him nationwide prominence. The sepia actor will be the only actor of his racial group in the current RKO studio production” (“jack carter here for rko role”).

With an intended salary of $200 a week (Gould, 1939), Jack Carter was the lowest paid actor of the cast. He was also living at the Dunbar Hotel, which was situated far away from many of the other actors who were living near Beverly Hills (Wilson-Welles: Richard Wilson). However, the history of the Dunbar Hotel suggests that Carter may have found a sense of community while living in Los Angeles. Carter was staying at a hotel where some of the most famous African American actors and activists frequented. From this information, we can understand that Welles attempted to integrate Carter into a rich cultural center for African Americans during the time period.

**Political Ideology in the Cast and Crew** 

Although we cannot conclude this completely, Welles indeed surrounded himself with left-leaning political affiliated people as evidenced by voting records of his cast and crew members found through ancestry databases. There are of course a couple of exceptions, but for the most part, his crew/cast seems as if they identify as Democrats. According to the book “Showbiz Politics,” it appears that Hollywood was very left-leaning in 1939/1940, as seen through the creation of the “Hollywood for Roosevelt” organization for the 1940 election in support of FDR (Brownell):

“Roosevelt supporters like Jack Warner framed political activities, on the domestic front and in raising awareness for the Allied war effort, in patriotic rhetoric, as they reminded the president that entertainment and motion pictures could shape public opinion and help dramatize international affairs in ways that portrayed Hitler as the villain and the Allied powers as the hero” (Brownell, p. 37).

This is especially important in the case of “The Heart of Darkness,” a film that had critical Nazi implications, so it makes sense that many people involved in the film would have the same political opinions that the film was perpetuating. 

**Alternative Roles**

Through looking at the tasks of the cast and crew, we were able to discover that a few members of the project took on roles not explicitly related to their official roles. For example, although Richard Barr is listed as an Assistant to Welles, it seems he had more of a producing role. He mostly worked with him through the Mercury Theatre from 1938 to 1941. In his biography, he writes:

"Working out of the administrative office, I did everything that someone else was not hired to do, including carrying to summer storage the furs of Orson's beautiful, blonde wife, Virginia. Since the Mercury was poor, they hired as few bodies as possible, so my life was kept busy" (Barr Manuscript: “‘You Have to Hock Your House’ The Story of a Producer”).

Other tasks included delivering Welles' weekly allowance to him, filling in acting roles in his radio productions, delivering messages to the theatre, scanning mail, acting as an extra in his plays, bringing Welles lunch, filling in for Welles at rehearsals, being an assistant stage manager and prompter for one of his productions, being an understudy for a production, and more. Another quote from his biography says: 

"My job, in addition to my backstage duties, was to help Orson as much as possible. This meant remaining until the close of rehearsal, getting him a cab to the Copley Hotel (or walking with him, if he had any energy left), returning early in the morning to be sure he was awake with breakfast and coffee ordered" (Barr Manuscript: “‘You Have to Hock Your House’ The Story of a Producer”).

When Barr relocated with Welles to California, he was put in charge of finding Welles housing, getting tables for him at restaurants and nightclubs, and during the preliminary period of “The Heart of Darkness,” his job was to write the history of the anthropology of the native tribes. Post “The Heart of Darkness,” Barr handled Welles' money, opening a bank account  and renting his houses for him.

Additionally, Miriam Geiger was another member of the crew that seemed to go above and beyond in her role on “The Heart of Darkness.” There are documents in which Geiger is referred to as a research clerk rather than a secretary, so perhaps her work focused more on research. She is listed as a principal research team member, ranked at the same level as Barr, so perhaps she was also working with him on his research of native tribes. In a memo from 1942, it is said that Geiger should be promoted to Assistant to Producer, then writing "in the instance of Orson Welles, Producer also means Writer, Director, and Actor," (RKO Welles Files) perhaps giving a glimpse of how Welles defined these roles.
