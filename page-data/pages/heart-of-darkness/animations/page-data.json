Welles made drawings that correspond to many parts of the planned film, from the proposed, non-diegetic introduction intended to explain the subjective camera technique to Kurtz’s speech presented in the visual and aural style of the Nuremberg Rallies. Welles’s drawings provide some of the best indications of what his first first-person singular approach to feature filmmaking might have looked like. Some also show vectors of movement that suggested we might adapt these drawings to produce fully-realized animations.
